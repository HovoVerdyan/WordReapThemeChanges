      <div class="to-beremoved">
	<?php get_template_part('directory/front-end/templates/freelancer/single/service_feedback'); ?>
      </div>
  Step 2. We wrap the original PHP call in othe css class in the same file in lines 484-486
      <div class="to-be-added">

  Step 3. We add following CSS code in additional CSS
     @media (max-width: 768px){
	.to-beremoved {
		display: none;
	}

  .wt-servicesslider figure img {
	  min-height: unset;  //We remove min-hright so as it wonn't cause problems whem changing sizes
    object-fit: contain;  //We put object fit contain so as it will contain the image in its full size
    object-position: center; //And object position shall be in center so as it sits tight ly and neatly
  }
